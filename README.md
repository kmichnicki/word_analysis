The point of this project is to do some basic word analysis on a text document. I've included Alice's Adventure's in Wonderland as alice.txt as an example file. 

For windows, run the command prompt(cmd). In command line navigate to the folder that contains both alice.txt, the text file, and the file most_common_words.py. Type the following:

type alice.txt | python most_common_words.py number_of_words

The program should tell you:
1. The most common words
2. A bar graph of the most common words
3. A scatter plot of the frequency of words of a particular length.
4. The mean.
5. The median.
6. The mode.

Note: in windows you may need to close each of the plots in order for the next step in the program to occur.
